This is gries, grading your A1. Below is the grading table. The grade for
correctness comes by truncating (not rounding) the grade given by the grading
program at the end of this file.
After the grading table are my comments and then the output of the grading program.
Please note that more points may be deducted in special cases, e.g. syntax errors
cause your submission not to compile.

Thanks for putting in the class invariant and method specifications so well. They help!


COMMENTS ON AREPHDSIBLINGS
 The spec we gave of arePhDSiblings says to return false
   if p is null. Your function gave a null-pointer exception or an assert exception
   when p was null.

TESTING PRECONDITIONS
 You did not test some preconditions properly, (e.g. what if adv1 and adv2 are same for constructor 3?) 

 In the constructors, you use   assert n instanceOf String;   While this works, there
    is a simpler way to make this test. Because Java has strong typing, the ONLY way
    parameter n will NOT be of type String is when the argument is null. So the preferred
    way of writing this is:    assert n != null;
