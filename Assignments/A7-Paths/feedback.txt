Hello, this is gries (djg17) grading your A7.

No errors --passed all our test cases.
I'll to see how well the grading guidelines are followed.

1. Deduction 0. Thanks for giving a comment on newHashMap. Why that funny name?
Why say in the name that it is a hashMap? What about calling it simply map, or sf?

You say that it "stores" things. Does you closet "store" clothes?
No, it CONTAINS the clothes that YOU store in it.

I never say "this data structure stores ..." because it's bad English. Although
I know I a fighting a losing battle.


2. Deduction 0. Why do this:

SFdata l= new SFdata(0, null);
newHashMap.put(start, l);

when you can do this?

newHashMap.put(start, new SFdata(0, null));


3. Deduction 1. Here's quote from the grading guidelines. You should have used w instead
of node1.

"A. You are implementing the abstract algorithm given in Piazza note @1815.
Your implementation should be as close as possible to the abstract algorithm in
terms of structure and variable names.
For example, the names F, f, and w should be used, since the variables appear in
both the abstract algorithm and its implementation."

4. Deduction 3. The expression newHashMap.get(node1) 4, 5, 6 times. the following
assignment should have been placed just after the assignment to node1 and then variable
wData can replace all those expression.

SFdata wData= newHashMap.get(node1);


5. Deduction 4. You placed the body in a try-statement. Why is it there? If a null-pointer
exception happens, there is a real error some place. The use of the try-catch means you
don't get to see the error. Don't do things like this, please.


6. Deduction 1. The call newHashMap.get(f).distance appears within the lop over the
neighbors, but nothing changes and it always produces the same result. It should have been
called once before this loop.

Grade: 91

Many people are receiving such deductions for not following the grading guidelines
carefully enough.
