This is Edward Li, grading your assignment A5.
The grading is based on whether each of the functions you were supposed to implement
works the way it is supposed to work. Before I start, I'll check your ReadMe file
to see whether there are special circumstances for me to watch out for.

README FILE
2. Deduction 0. The README.txt file is supposed to be a text file, but the first lines
in it are some sort of formatting information. Please learn to use a straight-text file
with no formatting.

3. Deduction 0. Thanks for letting me know about the issues you had with the assignment.
[say whatever you want to say, based on the feedback they gave.]

COLORING TOOLS
3. Deduction 1. If the user clicks the foreground color button and then hits the
cancel button in the dialog window, an error message appears. If the user cancels and
JColorChooser.showDialog returns null, nothing should happen.

5. Deduction 1. If the user clicks the background color button and then hits the
cancel button in the dialog window, an error message appears. If the user cancels and
JColorChooser.showDialog returns null, nothing should happen.

2. Deduction 0. GREAT! you managed to draw a real line from the first to
the last point, filled with random point! I know this is not easy, but
you did it!

LINE TOOL
5. Deduction 1. When drawing with the LINE tool, the red "SAVED" appears after only the
first click ---it shouldn't, because the user could click once and then change the tool
and nothing would be drawn.
